# 🌾 Smart Crop Recommendation System

This repository provides a machine learning pipeline to recommend the most suitable crop for a given soil composition. The project is inspired by modern precision agriculture practices, combining data science and farming knowledge.

## 📸 Project Visual

## 📊 Dataset
The data used (`soil_measures.csv`) includes:
- **N**: Nitrogen level
- **P**: Phosphorus level
- **K**: Potassium level
- **pH**: Soil pH value
- **crop**: Crop grown under these conditions

## 📘 Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Visualization of nutrient levels
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Predictive insights for crop recommendation

## 📁 Files
- `notebook.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with all data analysis and modeling
- `soil_measures.csv`: Soil dataset used for training
- `farmer_in_a_field.jpg`: Project image

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (e.g. `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`)
3. Run the notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb

## 💡 Future Work
* Expand to include real-time soil sensors
* Integrate weather data
* Build a web interface for easier farmer access
